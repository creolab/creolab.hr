I was a long time user or various different editor, all the way from Sublime Text to PHPStorm. Somehow I always came back to VS Code, but lately I started getting into Vim motions, and was trying to setup VS Code but I found it was simply lacking. in some areas.

I've heard good things about Zed, and since I did try it a while ago, and was very impressed how speedy it was, I decided to give it another try. And I'm glad I did, most of the problems I had with Zed and especially PHP development are now working without problems.

First let's the extensions out of the way:

- PHP support
- Emmet
- Tailwind Syntax
- Blade

This is basically it, apart for some themes.

Setting up the majority of the PHP funcionality is done via the LSP config.

And off course we will be setting it up for using vim motions, so should look similar to my setup in VS Code, but I feel like Zed could take the win here.
