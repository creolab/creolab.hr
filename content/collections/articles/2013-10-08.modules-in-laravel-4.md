I previously published a [simple tutorial post](http://creolab.hr/2013/05/modules-in-laravel-4) on taking the modular approach to building your applications in Laravel 4, but since then I needed a solution that I could use easily on different projects, so this was a no brainer, and I built a composer package for this purpose.

It's located at: [https://github.com/creolab/laravel-modules](https://github.com/creolab/laravel-modules)

You can install it by adding a new dependency to your composer.json file:

	"creolab/laravel-modules": "dev-master"

Then running "composer dump", and after that adding a new service provider to "app/config/app.php":

	'Creolab\LaravelModules\ServiceProvider'
    
Now you can create your modules directory under "app/modules", but you also need to enable autoloading for this directory by placing it in your autoload class inside "composer.json":

	"autoload": {
    	"classmap": [
        	"app/modules"
    	]
	}

Keep in mind that every time you create a new class in your module, you need to run "composer dump" if you set it up as above.

You could also set it up to autoload as PSR-0, but that would require a different directory structure, which I don't like for this :)

## Example

Anyway, you can see an example implementation here: [https://github.com/bstrahija/laravel-modules-example](https://github.com/bstrahija/laravel-modules-example)

The package is fairly fresh so any feedback is appreciated.

## New Vendor Name

As you might see I published the package on Github and Packagist under a new vendor name, so in the future I'm going to release most of my packages under this vendor name:

[https://github.com/creolab](https://github.com/creolab)
[https://packagist.org/packages/creolab/](https://packagist.org/packages/creolab/)
