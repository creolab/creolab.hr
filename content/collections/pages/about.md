Hello,

my name is Boris, I am an all-around developer with a main focus on backend web development in PHP, mostly Laravel and WordPress. Alot of experience in building custom themes and plugins for WordPress, also working as one of the main developers of the OptimizePress platform.

My skillset also includes coding in JavaScript (Vue, Angular, React), but also some oldschool knowledge in ActionScript, ColdFusion and ASP ;)

To see samples of my code check out my Github contributions at:
- [Personal Github](https://github.com/bstrahija)
- [Creo Github](https://github.com/creolab)
- [Influendo Github](https://github.com/influendo)

My free time is spent with my family, taking some photos, playing drums...
