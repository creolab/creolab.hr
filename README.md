# 🎸 Hey there! Welcome to my digital playground

I'm a web developer with 20+ years of battle scars and countless late-night debugging sessions under my belt. This is my personal portfolio – built with love, Laravel, and probably too much enthusiasm.

## 🤘 What's This All About?

This site is where I showcase my work, share random thoughts about web development, and occasionally post photos that I think are cooler than they actually are. Think of it as my digital business card, but with more personality and way better syntax highlighting.

## 🛠️ Built With The Good Stuff

**Backend Magic:**

- **PHP 8.4** - Because life's too short for old PHP
- **Laravel 12** - The framework that makes PHP feel like poetry
- **Statamic CMS 5** - For when WordPress feels too mainstream
- **Composer** - Keeping dependencies in line since forever

**Frontend Wizardry:**

- **Vite** - Lightning-fast builds (faster than my drum solos)
- **TailwindCSS** - Making CSS fun again
- **Alpine.js** - Vue's little sibling that packs a punch
- **PostCSS** - Because vanilla CSS is for vanilla people

**Content & Fun:**

- **Markdown** - Writing like a developer should

## 🎯 What I Do (When I'm Not Playing Drums)

I've been slinging code for over two decades, specializing in:

- **PHP Development** (Laravel, WordPress) - Making servers happy since the early 2000s
- **JavaScript Frameworks** (Vue, React, Svelte) - Because vanilla JS is so last century
- **Full-Stack Solutions** - From database to design, I've got you covered
- **Photography** - Capturing moments between debugging sessions

## 🥁 Life Outside The Terminal

When I'm not staring at code, you'll find me:

- **Playing drums** for two bands: [Dead Dog Summer](https://www.facebook.com/deaddogsummer) and [Youth Against](https://www.facebook.com/youthagainstck) 🥁
- **Smashing squash balls** (the sport, not the vegetable) 🏸
- **Taking photos** of things that catch my eye 📸
- **Keeping up with** the latest JavaScript framework that came out 5 minutes ago (they multiply faster than bugs)
